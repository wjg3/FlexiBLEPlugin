# FlexiBLEPlugin
An [OpenMM](https://github.com/openmm/openmm) plugin that implements the FlexiBLE QM/MM boundary potential [[10.1063/5.0067855](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0067855)]

## Installation Instruction
A little heads-up:  
The plugin relies on several packages to install. We recommend using Conda.  
The key software packages include: 

    OpenMM             8.0.0 and higher (7.3.0 works when changing LangevinMiddleIntegrator to LangevinIntegrator in tests) 
    CMake              3.27.6 (older versions may work, but you will need to modify the CMakeList.txt) 
    gcc_linux-64/gcc   (gcc-7,8,11 have all been tested, intel/2017 compiler can work, others are not guaranteed)
    doxygen

CUDA and OpenCL are not supported for this plugin.
Python APIs not configured yet.

1. Clone this repository to local machine. 
2. Use CCMake to configure, the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX and OPENMM_DIR should be the same as your openmm directory.
3. Remember to turn off the python wrapper in cmake configure.
5. Generate when you make sure the paths are right.
6. Type "make install". 
7. If you want to test FlexiBLE with molecular dynamics, alter the parameters of the tests within "platform/references/tests". The sample initial coordination and initial velocity files are within the "test" directory.
